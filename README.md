# MyInsta

In this personal project, I developed a clone of the “Instagram” application from scratch using the Laravel PHP framework. “MyInsta” includes all the core functionalities of Instagram, such as creating and editing profiles, following and unfollowing other users, and a feed section where posts appear. 
Additionally, the application supports photo uploads, likes, comments, and notifications, providing a comprehensive social media experience.
